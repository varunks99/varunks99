### Projects I'm proud to be a part of...
- #### 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼 [CoronaHelp](https://github.com/vaibhavmuchandi/coronahelp)
My friend and I built a website that provided information about stores open in my locality during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 and those that provided services such as home delivery at the time. Our goal was to encourage people to go out only when necessary and maintain social distancing, while providing them with essential information for their daily needs.

- #### 🪪 [eAarogya - Electronic Health Record Management Portal](https://github.com/vaibhavmuchandi/eAarogya-Portal-for-EHR-Management)
This project won the first place in the Smart India Hackathon 2020. eAarogya is a blockchain-based distributed platform (web and mobile) with a role based access sytem to help users manage their Electronic Health Records securely.

- #### 📒 [NoteVault](https://github.com/varunks99/NoteVault)
A note taking app built on the principles of Privacy by Design. No personally identifiable information collected, full encryption of notes and a secure login mechanism using MetaMask. Just you and your notes :)
